    <p class="erchi">"When you think of beef and the recipes that you are familiar with. There are a lot of meals that you can spruce up from this piece of meat. Whether it is part of a healthy dinner, a snack, or quick comfort food like burgers. It is rare to repeat the same meal unless it is your favorite. Some studies show individuals in their 20s that eat less meat in a week and exercise less tend to feel mentally stressed. Here, the reason is due to the lack of serotonin that soothes and dopamine that is made from tyrosine and tryptophan that are amino acids found in meat. Therefore, check various recipes online and forms to cook your meat and enjoy it even more"</p>
